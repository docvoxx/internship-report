During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Company Limited** from **September 8, 2025, to December 28, 2025**, I had the valuable opportunity to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and real-world application. This experience allowed me to develop both my technical skills and professional competencies in a corporate environment.

I participated in **8 office sessions** and **6 events** during this period. Although the total number of activities was relatively limited, each session provided meaningful opportunities to network with peers and learn from their experiences. Office visits also enabled me to interact closely with mentors, particularly Mr. Thinh and Mr. Hoang Anh, with whom I maintained frequent communication and exchange of ideas.

Throughout this internship, I have observed a gradual shift in my mindset—from a student perspective to a more mature, professional approach—adapting to the expectations and culture of a corporate environment. I consider this personal transformation essential for my future career development.

In terms of work ethic, I consistently aimed to complete tasks effectively, comply with workplace regulations, and actively collaborate with colleagues to enhance efficiency and productivity.

To objectively reflect on my performance, I evaluated myself across several key criteria:
