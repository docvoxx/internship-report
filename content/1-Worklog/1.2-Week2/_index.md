### Week 2 Objectives:

* Explore **Amazon EC2** by experimenting with different instance types, storage options (EBS, Instance Store), and deployment configurations.  
* Evaluate **AWS storage and compute services**—S3, EFS, FSx, MGN, Lightsail—by testing performance and understanding practical use cases.  
* Improve **resource management skills** using Tags & Resource Groups for organization, cost tracking, and simplified operations.  
* Learn to monitor infrastructure and applications using **Amazon CloudWatch** for logging, alerts, and performance insights.  
* Practice deploying applications using **Auto Scaling Groups** to evaluate system resilience and scalability.  
* Understand **AWS Transit Gateway** and network connectivity patterns to design efficient multi-VPC architectures.  
* Collaborate with team members to discuss project approaches, identify risks, and plan implementation strategies.
