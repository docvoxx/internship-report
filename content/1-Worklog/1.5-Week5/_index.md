### Week 5 Objectives:

* Develop a solid understanding of core database principles and the distinctions between **OLTP** and **OLAP** workloads.  
* Explore and gain hands-on experience with AWS database solutions: **Amazon RDS**, **Amazon Redshift**, and **Amazon ElastiCache**.  
* Enhance **SQL** proficiency, moving from fundamental commands to more advanced query techniques.  
* Learn best practices for deploying, managing, and optimizing AWS-managed databases.  
* Bridge theoretical database knowledge with practical implementation in the cloud.
