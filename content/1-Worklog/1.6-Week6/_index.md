### Week 6 Objectives:

* Continue exploring the internship environment and familiarize with AWS learning resources.  
* Begin the **AWS Fundamentals Specialization** on Coursera to strengthen foundational cloud knowledge.  
* Learn how to design AWS architectures using draw.io and review sample reference architectures (RAG Chatbot, AI Agents) from AWS official guidance.  
* Develop the project's **initial architecture draft** using the **Amazon Q CLI**, preparing for hands-on deployment.
