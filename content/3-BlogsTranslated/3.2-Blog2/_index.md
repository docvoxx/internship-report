## AWS Weekly Roundup: Celebrating 10 Years of Amazon Aurora, EC2 R8 Instances, Amazon Bedrock, and More (25 Aug 2025)

By Betty Zheng | 25 Aug 2025

This week’s roundup reflects on a decade of database innovation as Amazon Aurora marks its 10th anniversary. Aurora fundamentally changed database architecture by separating compute and storage, and over the years it has evolved from MySQL-compatible roots into a full-featured platform with serverless options, DSQL, I/O‑optimized pricing, zero‑ETL integrations, and support for generative AI workloads.

Notable releases this week

- AWS Billing and Cost Management: Customizable dashboards to aggregate cost data with widgets from Cost Explorer, Savings Plans, and Reserved Instance reports.
- Amazon Bedrock: Automatic availability for certain open‑weight OpenAI models and expanded batch inference support (Claude Sonnet 4, GPT‑OSS) to reduce cost for large inference workloads.
- Amazon EC2 R8i and R8i‑flex: New memory‑optimized instances offering up to ~20% better performance and 2.5× memory bandwidth vs R7i; R8i‑flex provides cost savings for workloads that don’t fully consume compute.
- Amazon S3: Batch data verification in S3 Batch Operations for large-scale checksum verification without downloading objects.
